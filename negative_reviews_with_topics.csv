samsung galaxy s duos ii s7582 dual sim factory unlocked international version black,Samsung,1,i would like to alert shoppers using amazon that some of these samsung galaxy s duos ii phones that are advertised for international use could very well be clonesknock offs of samsung products earlier this year i purchased one of these phones through a seller that sells products via amazon upon delivery i immediately noticed that the phone charger that was shipped with the phone did not mate up correctly to the phone so i needed to use a charger that i used on an old blackberry instead also i noted that the picture quality of the camera was pretty low grade which surprised me since samsung generally has good camera quality after longer use other strange things like my contact list would appear complete some days and then other days would be missing most of my contacts eventually every call that i was receiving would have the phone number of the caller but the name of the caller would be using only chinese characters i am using the phone in the usthe other day i ended up going to a tmobile store in my city and showed them the phone and the weirdness i was seeing since i was using one of their sim cards and they looked a the phone in detail it turns that they noticed that the case style was slightly different from a standard samsung build and that the file structure of the android os was missing key operating files that appear on samsung phones the blue tooth was not functioning either they came to the conclusion that the phone was a clonecounterfeit product considering all the tell tale signs noted above they noted that samsung products are commonly counterfeited and not only just this model i confirmed this with my own researchthe only good thing that i can say about this cloned samsung galaxy s duos phone is that at bare minimum the wifi function worked and i could insert a sim card from a country i visited in se asia and was able to at least make a phone call on that phone network otherwise for the price i paid for this phone and the problems that i managed to discover i basically got snookered there may be some legitimate sellers that are selling legitimate samsung galaxy s duos ii phones but considering the age of this model there are likely fewer phones in the s2 or older line up that are legitimateunmodifiedi am not sure i am allowed to list the name of the seller of this phone but if someone from amazon can follow up with me i would be happy to provide the name of the seller and send the phone back to amazon for their counterfeit product investigations organization to study based on my experience with this phone i would be very cautious about buying a phone on amazon unless it was through a main line vendor with a good reputation sometimes that is hard to determine so be careful everyone,Negative,Camera Quality

samsung galaxy s duos ii s7582 dual sim factory unlocked international version black,Samsung,2,i bought this phone in october 2014 so just over a year ago based on the great reviews but my experience has not been that good i almost wonder if mine is defective my biggest complaint is the wireless radio in this phone the wireless will just stop responding for no reason and apps like yelp and waze give connection errors very frustrating when your already on the road and you gps cant locate network the gps keeps working to show location but the app can no longer route yes ive tried several apps and they all lose network contact whenever i understand cell reception is part of this i have att but when i have 4 bars and yelp cant contact a server somethings wrong the only solution ive found is to repower the phone works fine after that for a bit same issue when transitioning from wifi to cell network leaving home getting in car it may or may not switch over again a restart may be necessary the other issue i have is the processor i know its just a phone but its really slow when loading apps ive bought a new phone just because i cant deal with the frustration of this one i guess for an unlocked dual sim phone youre just not going to get much for 150,Negative,Performance

samsung galaxy s duos ii s7582 dual sim factory unlocked international version black,Samsung,1,i would like to alert shoppers using amazon that some of these samsung galaxy s duos ii phones that are advertised for international use could very well be clonesknock offs of samsung products earlier this year i purchased one of these phones through a seller that sells products via amazon upon delivery i immediately noticed that the phone charger that was shipped with the phone did not mate up correctly to the phone so i needed to use a charger that i used on an old blackberry instead also i noted that the picture quality of the camera was pretty low grade which surprised me since samsung generally has good camera quality after longer use other strange things like my contact list would appear complete some days and then other days would be missing most of my contacts eventually every call that i was receiving would have the phone number of the caller but the name of the caller would be using only chinese characters i am using the phone in the usthe other day i ended up going to a tmobile store in my city and showed them the phone and the weirdness i was seeing since i was using one of their sim cards and they looked a the phone in detail it turns that they noticed that the case style was slightly different from a standard samsung build and that the file structure of the android os was missing key operating files that appear on samsung phones the blue tooth was not functioning either they came to the conclusion that the phone was a clonecounterfeit product considering all the tell tale signs noted above they noted that samsung products are commonly counterfeited and not only just this model i confirmed this with my own researchthe only good thing that i can say about this cloned samsung galaxy s duos phone is that at bare minimum the wifi function worked and i could insert a sim card from a country i visited in se asia and was able to at least make a phone call on that phone network otherwise for the price i paid for this phone and the problems that i managed to discover i basically got snookered there may be some legitimate sellers that are selling legitimate samsung galaxy s duos ii phones but considering the age of this model there are likely fewer phones in the s2 or older line up that are legitimateunmodifiedi am not sure i am allowed to list the name of the seller of this phone but if someone from amazon can follow up with me i would be happy to provide the name of the seller and send the phone back to amazon for their counterfeit product investigations organization to study based on my experience with this phone i would be very cautious about buying a phone on amazon unless it was through a main line vendor with a good reputation sometimes that is hard to determine so be careful everyone,Negative,Camera Quality

samsung galaxy s duos ii s7582 dual sim factory unlocked international version black,Samsung,3,battery life is very poor for a phone especially for one that is deemed as a travel phone with dual sims i took this phone with me to europe and in general it operated ok but i found the volume from the phone to be inadequate compared to my zte valet that i use at home the battery is inadequate as i found my cellphone dying before the end of each day despite charging it up fully at night when youre traveling you need a phone that will stay powered up to assist you with gps mapping direction apps etc i kept powering off to save power but it seems if you run a google maps navigation app it will suck the battery power pretty quick not good for travel unless youre always near a power source to keep topping off the battery which can add to potential memory issues i returned it,Negative,Battery Life
